                <h2>Kubernetes on Raspberry Pi&apos;s</h2>

                <p>How and why I built my own Kubernetes cluster using Raspberry Pi&apos;s</p>

                <h3>What have I built?</h3>
                <p>
                    I have built a cluster at home running Kubernetes with three raspberry pi 4&apos;s (Planning to add
                    more when necessary). The pi&apos;s are running Ubuntu. Github actions (or anything else) can be
                    used to automatially deploy applications to the cluster. The cluster uses Tr√¶fik to enable public
                    access to the applications running in the cluster and to handle TLS (to get https).
                </p>

                <h3>Why did I want to build this?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        &quot;Free&quot; to deploy any apps I want, instead of paying around $10 a month for each
                        hobby-app deployed to a cloud provider.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Practice Docker and Kubernetes, and all sorts of other things that must be set up. For example
                        setting up servers, tls, automatic build and deploy pipelines, ingresses, etc. It can be
                        expensive to run a full kubernetes cluster in the cloud just for practice and fun.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Have a place where all things has to be done manually, instead of just clicking buttons at a
                        cloud provider and using their api&apos;s.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How did I set it all up (short version)?</h3>
                <p>
                    Most of setting it up came down to finding people that had done exactly the same, or at least
                    something similar. Since people are so awesome, I could basically just follow some different guides
                    that I found, and patch those together, kind of. I would like to give a lot of credit to those that
                    have made all these guides. Here is a short step by step list for how I set up the cluster with
                    links to sources that I used for each step:

                                A video by LearnLinuxTV on youtube

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I got inspired by this video. I used this video to buy hardware, install Ubuntu on each Pi,
                            and hook it all up and verifying that they were all running and available on my local
                            network. Link youtube

                            I used this video to practice setting up servers, and of course again learning a lot. Mostly
                            I used Lesson 2.

                        <p>
                            This awesome video increased my understanding a lot of the whole thing. I used the same
                            approach as Jeff Geerling to install Kubernetes on all the Pi&apos;s with the Ansible
                            playbook that he mentioned.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I followed Jeff Geerling&apos;s guide to install Prometheus and Grafana on the cluster by
                            use of the mentioned Ansible Playbook.

                <p>
                    At this point the most important stuff has been set up, a kubernetes cluster running on Raspberry
                    Pi&apos;s. Next on the todo list:

                <p>
                    The pi&apos;s got very warm, so I bought a cooling unit. Now the temperatures are a little bit more
                    under control. And it looks much better :)
